# Connection Request Withdrawal Script

This script automates the process of withdrawing connection requests on a webpage. It interacts with the webpage's buttons to withdraw the requests, saving time and effort.

## Usage

1. Open the webpage where you want to withdraw connection requests.
2. Copy the code from the `script.js` file and paste it into the browser's developer console.
3. The script will prompt you to enter the number of times to run and the time delay between each run.
4. Provide the required inputs and press Enter.
5. The script will run, automatically withdrawing the connection requests as per your input.

Please note that this script assumes a specific button structure on the webpage for withdrawal. Make sure the webpage matches the expected structure for the script to work correctly.

## User Input

The script prompts for the following information:

- **Number of times to run**: Enter the desired number of times to run the withdrawal process.
- **Time delay (in seconds)**: Enter the time delay between each run. This determines the interval at which the script withdraws the requests.

## Compatibility

This script works in modern web browsers that support JavaScript and have a developer console.

## Disclaimer

Use this script responsibly and within the terms of service of the webpage you are using it on. The script automates repetitive tasks but should not be used for malicious purposes or violate any applicable laws or regulations.
